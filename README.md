## Bangla News Headlines Categorization Using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): Project Overview
- Created a tool that can categorizes the Bengali news headlines into six category (**`National, Politics, International, Sports, Amusement, IT`**) using deep recurrent neural network.
- A dataset of **`0.1 Million`** news headlines is created. In built chrome web scrapper used for scraping the news headlines from different Bengali online news portals such as **`Dainik Jugantor, Dainik Ittefaq, Dainik Kaler Kontho`** and so on.    
- **`Word embeeding`** feature represtations technique is used for extracting the semantic meaning of the words.
- A deep learning model has been built by using a **`bidirectional gated recurrent network`**.
- Finally, the model performance  evaluated using various evaluation measures such as **`confusion matrix, accuracy , precision, recall and f1-score`**.
